Why&#39;,\n &#39;is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at&#39;,\n &#39;some time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a&#39;,\n &#39;passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first&#39;,\n &#39;told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the&#39;,\n &#39;old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate&#39;,\n &#39;deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning.&#39;,\n &#39;And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because&#39;,\n &#39;he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain,&#39;,\n &#39;plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see&#39;,\n &#39;in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of&#39;,\n &#39;life; and this is the key to it all.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin&#39;,\n &#39;to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs,&#39;,\n &#39;I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger.&#39;,\n &#39;For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is&#39;,\n &#39;but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers get&#39;,\n &#34;sea-sick--grow quarrelsome--don&#39;t sleep of nights--do not enjoy&#34;,\n &#39;themselves much, as a general thing;--no, I never go as a passenger;&#39;,\n &#39;nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a&#39;,\n &#39;Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction&#39;,\n &#39;of such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all&#39;,\n &#39;honourable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind&#39;,\n &#39;whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself,&#39;,\n &#39;without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not.&#39;,\n &#39;And as for going as cook,--though I confess there is considerable glory&#39;,\n &#39;in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board--yet, somehow,&#39;,\n &#39;I never fancied broiling fowls;--though once broiled, judiciously&#39;,\n &#39;buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who&#39;,\n &#39;will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled&#39;,\n &#39;fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old&#39;,\n &#39;Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the&#39;,\n &#39;mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,&#39;,\n &#39;plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.&#39;,\n &#39;True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to&#39;,\n &#39;spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort&#39;,\n &#34;of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one&#39;s sense of honour,&#34;,\n &#39;particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the&#39;,\n &#39;Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all,&#39;,\n &#39;if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been&#39;,\n &#39;lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand&#39;,\n &#39;in awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a&#39;,\n &#39;schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and&#39;,\n &#39;the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off in&#39;,\n &#39;time.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom&#39;,\n &#39;and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed,&#39;,\n &#39;I mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel&#39;,\n &#39;Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and&#39;,\n &#34;respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain&#39;t&#34;,\n &#39;a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may&#39;,\n &#39;order me about--however they may thump and punch me about, I have the&#39;,\n &#39;satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is&#39;,\n &#39;one way or other served in much the same way--either in a physical&#39;,\n &#39;or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is&#39;,\n &#34;passed round, and all hands should rub each other&#39;s shoulder-blades, and&#34;,\n &#39;be content.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of&#39;,\n &#39;paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single&#39;,\n &#39;penny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must&#39;,\n &#39;pay. And there is all the difference in the world between paying&#39;,\n &#39;and being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable&#39;,\n &#39;infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But BEING&#39;,\n &#39;PAID,--what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man&#39;,\n &#39;receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly&#39;,\n &#39;believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no account&#39;,\n &#39;can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves&#39;,\n &#39;to perdition!&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome&#39;,\n &#39;exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world,&#39;,\n &#39;head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is,&#39;,\n &#39;if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the&#39;,\n &#39;Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from&#39;,\n &#39;the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not&#39;,\n &#39;so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many&#39;,\n &#39;other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it.&#39;,\n &#39;But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a&#39;,\n &#39;merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling&#39;,\n &#39;voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the&#39;,\n &#39;constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me&#39;,\n &#39;in some unaccountable way--he can better answer than any one else. And,&#39;,\n &#39;doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand&#39;,\n &#39;programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as&#39;,\n &#39;a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances.&#39;,\n &#39;I take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this:&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;GRAND CONTESTED ELECTION FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the&#39;,\n &#39;Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others&#39;,\n &#39;were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and&#39;,\n &#39;easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces--though&#39;,\n &#39;I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the&#39;,\n &#39;circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives&#39;,\n &#39;which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced&#39;,\n &#39;me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the&#39;,\n &#39;delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill&#39;,\n &#39;and discriminating judgment.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great&#39;,\n &#39;whale himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my&#39;,\n &#39;curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island&#39;,\n &#39;bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all&#39;,\n &#39;the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds, helped&#39;,\n &#39;to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things would not&#39;,\n &#39;have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an everlasting&#39;,\n &#39;itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on&#39;,\n &#39;barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a&#39;,\n &#39;horror, and could still be social with it--would they let me--since it&#39;,\n &#39;is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place&#39;,\n &#39;one lodges in.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the&#39;,\n &#39;great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild&#39;,\n &#39;conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into&#39;,\n &#39;my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them&#39;,\n &#39;all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;CHAPTER 2. The Carpet-Bag.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm,&#39;,\n &#39;and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city of&#39;,\n &#39;old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night in&#39;,\n &#39;December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet&#39;,\n &#39;for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching that place&#39;,\n &#39;would offer, till the following Monday.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at&#39;,\n &#39;this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well&#39;,\n &#39;be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was&#39;,\n &#39;made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a&#39;,\n &#39;fine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous&#39;,\n &#39;old island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has&#39;,\n &#39;of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and though&#39;,\n &#39;in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket&#39;,\n &#39;was her great original--the Tyre of this Carthage;--the place where the&#39;,\n &#39;first dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket&#39;,\n &#39;did those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes to&#39;,\n &#39;give chase to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did that&#39;,\n &#39;first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported&#39;,\n &#39;cobblestones--so goes the story--to throw at the whales, in order to&#39;,\n &#39;discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit?&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me&#39;,\n &#39;in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a&#39;,\n &#39;matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a&#39;,\n &#39;very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold&#39;,\n &#39;and cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had&#39;,\n &#39;sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,--So,&#39;,\n &#39;wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of&#39;,\n &#39;a dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the&#39;,\n &#39;north with the darkness towards the south--wherever in your wisdom you&#39;,\n &#39;may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire&#39;,\n &#34;the price, and don&#39;t be too particular.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of &#34;The&#39;,\n &#39;Crossed Harpoons&#34;--but it looked too expensive and jolly there. Further&#39;,\n &#39;on, from the bright red windows of the &#34;Sword-Fish Inn,&#34; there came such&#39;,\n &#39;fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from&#39;,\n &#39;before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches&#39;,\n &#39;thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,--rather weary for me, when I struck&#39;,\n &#39;my foot against the flinty projections, because from hard, remorseless&#39;,\n &#39;service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight. Too&#39;,\n &#39;expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the&#39;,\n &#39;broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses&#39;,\n &#34;within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don&#39;t you hear? get away&#34;,\n &#39;from before the door; your patched boots are stopping the way. So on I&#39;,\n &#39;went. I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward, for&#39;,\n &#39;there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand,&#39;,\n &#39;and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At&#39;,\n &#39;this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of&#39;,\n &#39;the town proved all but deserted. But presently I came to a smoky light&#39;,\n &#39;proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood invitingly&#39;,\n &#39;open. It had a careless look, as if it were meant for the uses of the&#39;,\n &#39;public; so, entering, the first thing I did was to stumble over an&#39;,\n &#39;ash-box in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying particles almost&#39;,\n &#39;choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city, Gomorrah? But &#34;The&#39;,\n &#39;Crossed Harpoons,&#34; and &#34;The Sword-Fish?&#34;--this, then must needs be the&#39;,\n &#39;sign of &#34;The Trap.&#34; However, I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice&#39;,\n &#39;within, pushed on and opened a second, interior door.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black&#39;,\n &#39;faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel&#39;,\n &#39;of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the&#39;,\n &#34;preacher&#39;s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and&#34;,\n &#39;wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing out,&#39;,\n &#34;Wretched entertainment at the sign of &#39;The Trap!&#39;&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks,&#39;,\n &#39;and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a swinging&#39;,\n &#39;sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly representing&#39;,\n &#39;a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words underneath--&#34;The&#39;,\n &#39;Spouter Inn:--Peter Coffin.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;Coffin?--Spouter?--Rather ominous in that particular connexion, thought&#39;,\n &#39;I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this&#39;,\n &#39;Peter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and&#39;,\n &#39;the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated little&#39;,\n &#39;wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from&#39;,\n &#39;the ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a&#39;,\n &#39;poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very&#39;,\n &#39;spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;It was a queer sort of place--a gable-ended old house, one side palsied&#39;,\n &#39;as it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner,&#39;,\n &#39;where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever&#39;,\n &#34;it did about poor Paul&#39;s tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless, is a&#34;,\n &#39;mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the hob&#39;,\n &#39;quietly toasting for bed. &#34;In judging of that tempestuous wind called&#39;,\n &#39;Euroclydon,&#34; says an old writer--of whose works I possess the only copy&#39;,\n &#39;extant--&#34;it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou lookest out at&#39;,\n &#39;it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside, or whether&#39;,\n &#39;thou observest it from that sashless window, where the frost is on both&#39;,\n &#39;sides, and of which the wight Death is the only glazier.&#34; True enough,&#39;,\n &#39;thought I, as this passage occurred to my mind--old black-letter, thou&#39;,\n &#39;reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is&#39;,\n &#34;the house. What a pity they didn&#39;t stop up the chinks and the crannies&#34;,\n &#34;though, and thrust in a little lint here and there. But it&#39;s too late&#34;,\n &#39;to make any improvements now. The universe is finished; the copestone&#39;,\n &#39;is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago. Poor Lazarus&#39;,\n &#39;there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow, and&#39;,\n &#39;shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he might plug up both ears&#39;,\n &#39;with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not&#39;,\n &#39;keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his&#39;,\n &#39;red silken wrapper--(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What&#39;,\n &#39;a fine frosty night; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them&#39;,\n &#39;talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give&#39;,\n &#39;me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;But what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up&#39;,\n &#39;to the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra&#39;,\n &#39;than here? Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the&#39;,\n &#39;line of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in&#39;,\n &#39;order to keep out this frost?&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the&#39;,\n &#39;door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be&#39;,\n &#39;moored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a&#39;,\n &#39;Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of a&#39;,\n &#39;temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there is&#39;,\n &#39;plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet,&#39;,\n &#39;and see what sort of a place this &#34;Spouter&#34; may be.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;CHAPTER 3. The Spouter-Inn.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,&#39;,\n &#39;low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of&#39;,\n &#39;the bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large&#39;,\n &#39;oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the&#39;,\n &#39;unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent&#39;,\n &#39;study and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of&#39;,\n &#39;the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its&#39;,\n &#39;purpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first&#39;,\n &#39;you almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New&#39;,\n &#39;England hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint&#39;,\n &#39;of much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and&#39;,\n &#39;especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the&#39;,\n &#39;entry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however&#39;,\n &#39;wild, might not be altogether unwarranted.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous,&#39;,\n &#39;black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three&#39;,\n &#39;blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast. A boggy,&#39;,\n &#39;soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted.&#39;,\n &#39;Yet was there a sort of indefinite, half-attained, unimaginable&#39;,\n &#39;sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it, till you involuntarily&#39;,\n &#39;took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting&#39;,\n &#39;meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas, deceptive idea would dart you&#39;,\n &#34;through.--It&#39;s the Black Sea in a midnight gale.--It&#39;s the unnatural&#34;,\n &#34;combat of the four primal elements.--It&#39;s a blasted heath.--It&#39;s a&#34;,\n &#34;Hyperborean winter scene.--It&#39;s the breaking-up of the icebound stream&#34;,\n &#39;of Time. But at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous&#39;,\n &#34;something in the picture&#39;s midst. THAT once found out, and all the rest&#34;,\n &#39;were plain. But stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic&#39;,\n &#39;fish? even the great leviathan himself?&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#34;In fact, the artist&#39;s design seemed this: a final theory of my own,&#34;,\n &#39;partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom&#39;,\n &#39;I conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner in a&#39;,\n &#39;great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its three&#39;,\n &#39;dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale, purposing to&#39;,\n &#39;spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of impaling himself&#39;,\n &#39;upon the three mast-heads.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish&#39;,\n &#39;array of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with&#39;,\n &#39;glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots of&#39;,\n &#39;human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping round&#39;,\n &#39;like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed mower. You&#39;,\n &#39;shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage&#39;,\n &#39;could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking, horrifying&#39;,\n &#39;implement. Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons&#39;,\n &#39;all broken and deformed. Some were storied weapons. With this once long&#39;,\n &#39;lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen&#39;,\n &#39;whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that harpoon--so like a&#39;,\n &#39;corkscrew now--was flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale,&#39;,\n &#39;years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco. The original iron entered&#39;,\n &#39;nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a&#39;,\n &#39;man, travelled full forty feet, and at last was found imbedded in the&#39;,\n &#39;hump.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way--cut&#39;,\n &#39;through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with&#39;,\n &#39;fireplaces all round--you enter the public room. A still duskier place&#39;,\n &#39;is this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled&#39;,\n &#34;planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft&#39;s&#34;,\n &#39;cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored&#39;,\n &#39;old ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like&#39;,\n &#39;table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities&#39;,\n &#34;gathered from this wide world&#39;s remotest nooks. Projecting from the&#34;,\n &#39;further angle of the room stands a dark-looking den--the bar--a rude&#39;,\n &#34;attempt at a right whale&#39;s head. Be that how it may, there stands the&#34;,\n &#34;vast arched bone of the whale&#39;s jaw, so wide, a coach might almost drive&#34;,\n &#39;beneath it. Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old decanters,&#39;,\n &#39;bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction, like another&#39;,\n &#39;cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him), bustles a little&#39;,\n &#39;withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells the sailors&#39;,\n &#39;deliriums and death.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though&#39;,\n &#39;true cylinders without--within, the villanous green goggling glasses&#39;,\n &#39;deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians&#39;,\n &#34;rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads&#39; goblets. Fill to&#34;,\n &#39;THIS mark, and your charge is but a penny; to THIS a penny more; and so&#39;,\n &#39;on to the full glass--the Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp down for&#39;,\n &#39;a shilling.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about&#39;,\n &#39;a table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of SKRIMSHANDER. I&#39;,\n &#39;sought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with a&#39;,\n &#39;room, received for answer that his house was full--not a bed unoccupied.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;But avast,&#34; he added, tapping his forehead, &#34;you haint no objections&#39;,\n &#34;to sharing a harpooneer&#39;s blanket, have ye? I s&#39;pose you are goin&#39;&#34;,\n &#39;a-whalin\\&#39;, so you\\&#39;d better get used to that sort of thing.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should&#39;,\n &#39;ever do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and&#39;,\n &#39;that if he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the&#39;,\n &#39;harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander&#39;,\n &#39;further about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up with&#39;,\n &#34;the half of any decent man&#39;s blanket.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?--you want supper?&#39;,\n &#39;Supper\\&#39;ll be ready directly.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the&#39;,\n &#39;Battery. At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with&#39;,\n &#39;his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space&#39;,\n &#39;between his legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but&#39;,\n &#34;he didn&#39;t make much headway, I thought.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an&#39;,\n &#39;adjoining room. It was cold as Iceland--no fire at all--the landlord&#39;,\n &#34;said he couldn&#39;t afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each&#34;,\n &#39;in a winding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and&#39;,\n &#39;hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But&#39;,\n &#39;the fare was of the most substantial kind--not only meat and potatoes,&#39;,\n &#39;but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper!

Why&#39;,\n &#39;is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at&#39;,\n &#39;some time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a&#39;,\n &#39;passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first&#39;,\n &#39;told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the&#39;,\n &#39;old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate&#39;,\n &#39;deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning.&#39;,\n &#39;And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because&#39;,\n &#39;he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain,&#39;,\n &#39;plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see&#39;,\n &#39;in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of&#39;,\n &#39;life; and this is the key to it all.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin&#39;,\n &#39;to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs,&#39;,\n &#39;I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger.&#39;,\n &#39;For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is&#39;,\n &#39;but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers get&#39;,\n &#34;sea-sick--grow quarrelsome--don&#39;t sleep of nights--do not enjoy&#34;,\n &#39;themselves much, as a general thing;--no, I never go as a passenger;&#39;,\n &#39;nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a&#39;,\n &#39;Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction&#39;,\n &#39;of such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all&#39;,\n &#39;honourable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind&#39;,\n &#39;whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself,&#39;,\n &#39;without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not.&#39;,\n &#39;And as for going as cook,--though I confess there is considerable glory&#39;,\n &#39;in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board--yet, somehow,&#39;,\n &#39;I never fancied broiling fowls;--though once broiled, judiciously&#39;,\n &#39;buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who&#39;,\n &#39;will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled&#39;,\n &#39;fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old&#39;,\n &#39;Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the&#39;,\n &#39;mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,&#39;,\n &#39;plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.&#39;,\n &#39;True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to&#39;,\n &#39;spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort&#39;,\n &#34;of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one&#39;s sense of honour,&#34;,\n &#39;particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the&#39;,\n &#39;Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all,&#39;,\n &#39;if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been&#39;,\n &#39;lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand&#39;,\n &#39;in awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a&#39;,\n &#39;schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and&#39;,\n &#39;the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off in&#39;,\n &#39;time.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom&#39;,\n &#39;and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed,&#39;,\n &#39;I mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel&#39;,\n &#39;Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and&#39;,\n &#34;respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain&#39;t&#34;,\n &#39;a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may&#39;,\n &#39;order me about--however they may thump and punch me about, I have the&#39;,\n &#39;satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is&#39;,\n &#39;one way or other served in much the same way--either in a physical&#39;,\n &#39;or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is&#39;,\n &#34;passed round, and all hands should rub each other&#39;s shoulder-blades, and&#34;,\n &#39;be content.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of&#39;,\n &#39;paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single&#39;,\n &#39;penny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must&#39;,\n &#39;pay. And there is all the difference in the world between paying&#39;,\n &#39;and being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable&#39;,\n &#39;infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But BEING&#39;,\n &#39;PAID,--what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man&#39;,\n &#39;receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly&#39;,\n &#39;believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no account&#39;,\n &#39;can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves&#39;,\n &#39;to perdition!&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome&#39;,\n &#39;exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world,&#39;,\n &#39;head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is,&#39;,\n &#39;if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the&#39;,\n &#39;Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from&#39;,\n &#39;the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not&#39;,\n &#39;so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many&#39;,\n &#39;other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it.&#39;,\n &#39;But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a&#39;,\n &#39;merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling&#39;,\n &#39;voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the&#39;,\n &#39;constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me&#39;,\n &#39;in some unaccountable way--he can better answer than any one else. And,&#39;,\n &#39;doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand&#39;,\n &#39;programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as&#39;,\n &#39;a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances.&#39;,\n &#39;I take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this:&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;GRAND CONTESTED ELECTION FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the&#39;,\n &#39;Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others&#39;,\n &#39;were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and&#39;,\n &#39;easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces--though&#39;,\n &#39;I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the&#39;,\n &#39;circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives&#39;,\n &#39;which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced&#39;,\n &#39;me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the&#39;,\n &#39;delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill&#39;,\n &#39;and discriminating judgment.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great&#39;,\n &#39;whale himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my&#39;,\n &#39;curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island&#39;,\n &#39;bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all&#39;,\n &#39;the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds, helped&#39;,\n &#39;to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things would not&#39;,\n &#39;have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an everlasting&#39;,\n &#39;itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on&#39;,\n &#39;barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a&#39;,\n &#39;horror, and could still be social with it--would they let me--since it&#39;,\n &#39;is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place&#39;,\n &#39;one lodges in.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the&#39;,\n &#39;great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild&#39;,\n &#39;conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into&#39;,\n &#39;my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them&#39;,\n &#39;all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;CHAPTER 2. The Carpet-Bag.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm,&#39;,\n &#39;and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city of&#39;,\n &#39;old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night in&#39;,\n &#39;December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet&#39;,\n &#39;for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching that place&#39;,\n &#39;would offer, till the following Monday.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at&#39;,\n &#39;this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well&#39;,\n &#39;be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was&#39;,\n &#39;made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a&#39;,\n &#39;fine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous&#39;,\n &#39;old island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has&#39;,\n &#39;of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and though&#39;,\n &#39;in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket&#39;,\n &#39;was her great original--the Tyre of this Carthage;--the place where the&#39;,\n &#39;first dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket&#39;,\n &#39;did those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes to&#39;,\n &#39;give chase to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did that&#39;,\n &#39;first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported&#39;,\n &#39;cobblestones--so goes the story--to throw at the whales, in order to&#39;,\n &#39;discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit?&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me&#39;,\n &#39;in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a&#39;,\n &#39;matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a&#39;,\n &#39;very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold&#39;,\n &#39;and cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had&#39;,\n &#39;sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,--So,&#39;,\n &#39;wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of&#39;,\n &#39;a dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the&#39;,\n &#39;north with the darkness towards the south--wherever in your wisdom you&#39;,\n &#39;may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire&#39;,\n &#34;the price, and don&#39;t be too particular.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of &#34;The&#39;,\n &#39;Crossed Harpoons&#34;--but it looked too expensive and jolly there. Further&#39;,\n &#39;on, from the bright red windows of the &#34;Sword-Fish Inn,&#34; there came such&#39;,\n &#39;fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from&#39;,\n &#39;before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches&#39;,\n &#39;thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,--rather weary for me, when I struck&#39;,\n &#39;my foot against the flinty projections, because from hard, remorseless&#39;,\n &#39;service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight. Too&#39;,\n &#39;expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the&#39;,\n &#39;broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses&#39;,\n &#34;within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don&#39;t you hear? get away&#34;,\n &#39;from before the door; your patched boots are stopping the way. So on I&#39;,\n &#39;went. I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward, for&#39;,\n &#39;there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand,&#39;,\n &#39;and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At&#39;,\n &#39;this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of&#39;,\n &#39;the town proved all but deserted. But presently I came to a smoky light&#39;,\n &#39;proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood invitingly&#39;,\n &#39;open. It had a careless look, as if it were meant for the uses of the&#39;,\n &#39;public; so, entering, the first thing I did was to stumble over an&#39;,\n &#39;ash-box in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying particles almost&#39;,\n &#39;choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city, Gomorrah? But &#34;The&#39;,\n &#39;Crossed Harpoons,&#34; and &#34;The Sword-Fish?&#34;--this, then must needs be the&#39;,\n &#39;sign of &#34;The Trap.&#34; However, I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice&#39;,\n &#39;within, pushed on and opened a second, interior door.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black&#39;,\n &#39;faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel&#39;,\n &#39;of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the&#39;,\n &#34;preacher&#39;s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and&#34;,\n &#39;wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing out,&#39;,\n &#34;Wretched entertainment at the sign of &#39;The Trap!&#39;&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks,&#39;,\n &#39;and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a swinging&#39;,\n &#39;sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly representing&#39;,\n &#39;a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words underneath--&#34;The&#39;,\n &#39;Spouter Inn:--Peter Coffin.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;Coffin?--Spouter?--Rather ominous in that particular connexion, thought&#39;,\n &#39;I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this&#39;,\n &#39;Peter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and&#39;,\n &#39;the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated little&#39;,\n &#39;wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from&#39;,\n &#39;the ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a&#39;,\n &#39;poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very&#39;,\n &#39;spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;It was a queer sort of place--a gable-ended old house, one side palsied&#39;,\n &#39;as it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner,&#39;,\n &#39;where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever&#39;,\n &#34;it did about poor Paul&#39;s tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless, is a&#34;,\n &#39;mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the hob&#39;,\n &#39;quietly toasting for bed. &#34;In judging of that tempestuous wind called&#39;,\n &#39;Euroclydon,&#34; says an old writer--of whose works I possess the only copy&#39;,\n &#39;extant--&#34;it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou lookest out at&#39;,\n &#39;it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside, or whether&#39;,\n &#39;thou observest it from that sashless window, where the frost is on both&#39;,\n &#39;sides, and of which the wight Death is the only glazier.&#34; True enough,&#39;,\n &#39;thought I, as this passage occurred to my mind--old black-letter, thou&#39;,\n &#39;reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is&#39;,\n &#34;the house. What a pity they didn&#39;t stop up the chinks and the crannies&#34;,\n &#34;though, and thrust in a little lint here and there. But it&#39;s too late&#34;,\n &#39;to make any improvements now. The universe is finished; the copestone&#39;,\n &#39;is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago. Poor Lazarus&#39;,\n &#39;there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow, and&#39;,\n &#39;shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he might plug up both ears&#39;,\n &#39;with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not&#39;,\n &#39;keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his&#39;,\n &#39;red silken wrapper--(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What&#39;,\n &#39;a fine frosty night; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them&#39;,\n &#39;talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give&#39;,\n &#39;me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;But what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up&#39;,\n &#39;to the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra&#39;,\n &#39;than here? Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the&#39;,\n &#39;line of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in&#39;,\n &#39;order to keep out this frost?&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the&#39;,\n &#39;door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be&#39;,\n &#39;moored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a&#39;,\n &#39;Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of a&#39;,\n &#39;temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there is&#39;,\n &#39;plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet,&#39;,\n &#39;and see what sort of a place this &#34;Spouter&#34; may be.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;CHAPTER 3. The Spouter-Inn.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,&#39;,\n &#39;low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of&#39;,\n &#39;the bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large&#39;,\n &#39;oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the&#39;,\n &#39;unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent&#39;,\n &#39;study and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of&#39;,\n &#39;the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its&#39;,\n &#39;purpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first&#39;,\n &#39;you almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New&#39;,\n &#39;England hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint&#39;,\n &#39;of much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and&#39;,\n &#39;especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the&#39;,\n &#39;entry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however&#39;,\n &#39;wild, might not be altogether unwarranted.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous,&#39;,\n &#39;black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three&#39;,\n &#39;blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast. A boggy,&#39;,\n &#39;soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted.&#39;,\n &#39;Yet was there a sort of indefinite, half-attained, unimaginable&#39;,\n &#39;sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it, till you involuntarily&#39;,\n &#39;took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting&#39;,\n &#39;meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas, deceptive idea would dart you&#39;,\n &#34;through.--It&#39;s the Black Sea in a midnight gale.--It&#39;s the unnatural&#34;,\n &#34;combat of the four primal elements.--It&#39;s a blasted heath.--It&#39;s a&#34;,\n &#34;Hyperborean winter scene.--It&#39;s the breaking-up of the icebound stream&#34;,\n &#39;of Time. But at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous&#39;,\n &#34;something in the picture&#39;s midst. THAT once found out, and all the rest&#34;,\n &#39;were plain. But stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic&#39;,\n &#39;fish? even the great leviathan himself?&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#34;In fact, the artist&#39;s design seemed this: a final theory of my own,&#34;,\n &#39;partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom&#39;,\n &#39;I conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner in a&#39;,\n &#39;great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its three&#39;,\n &#39;dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale, purposing to&#39;,\n &#39;spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of impaling himself&#39;,\n &#39;upon the three mast-heads.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish&#39;,\n &#39;array of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with&#39;,\n &#39;glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots of&#39;,\n &#39;human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping round&#39;,\n &#39;like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed mower. You&#39;,\n &#39;shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage&#39;,\n &#39;could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking, horrifying&#39;,\n &#39;implement. Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons&#39;,\n &#39;all broken and deformed. Some were storied weapons. With this once long&#39;,\n &#39;lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen&#39;,\n &#39;whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that harpoon--so like a&#39;,\n &#39;corkscrew now--was flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale,&#39;,\n &#39;years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco. The original iron entered&#39;,\n &#39;nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a&#39;,\n &#39;man, travelled full forty feet, and at last was found imbedded in the&#39;,\n &#39;hump.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way--cut&#39;,\n &#39;through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with&#39;,\n &#39;fireplaces all round--you enter the public room. A still duskier place&#39;,\n &#39;is this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled&#39;,\n &#34;planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft&#39;s&#34;,\n &#39;cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored&#39;,\n &#39;old ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like&#39;,\n &#39;table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities&#39;,\n &#34;gathered from this wide world&#39;s remotest nooks. Projecting from the&#34;,\n &#39;further angle of the room stands a dark-looking den--the bar--a rude&#39;,\n &#34;attempt at a right whale&#39;s head. Be that how it may, there stands the&#34;,\n &#34;vast arched bone of the whale&#39;s jaw, so wide, a coach might almost drive&#34;,\n &#39;beneath it. Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old decanters,&#39;,\n &#39;bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction, like another&#39;,\n &#39;cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him), bustles a little&#39;,\n &#39;withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells the sailors&#39;,\n &#39;deliriums and death.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though&#39;,\n &#39;true cylinders without--within, the villanous green goggling glasses&#39;,\n &#39;deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians&#39;,\n &#34;rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads&#39; goblets. Fill to&#34;,\n &#39;THIS mark, and your charge is but a penny; to THIS a penny more; and so&#39;,\n &#39;on to the full glass--the Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp down for&#39;,\n &#39;a shilling.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about&#39;,\n &#39;a table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of SKRIMSHANDER. I&#39;,\n &#39;sought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with a&#39;,\n &#39;room, received for answer that his house was full--not a bed unoccupied.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;But avast,&#34; he added, tapping his forehead, &#34;you haint no objections&#39;,\n &#34;to sharing a harpooneer&#39;s blanket, have ye? I s&#39;pose you are goin&#39;&#34;,\n &#39;a-whalin\\&#39;, so you\\&#39;d better get used to that sort of thing.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should&#39;,\n &#39;ever do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and&#39;,\n &#39;that if he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the&#39;,\n &#39;harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander&#39;,\n &#39;further about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up with&#39;,\n &#34;the half of any decent man&#39;s blanket.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?--you want supper?&#39;,\n &#39;Supper\\&#39;ll be ready directly.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the&#39;,\n &#39;Battery. At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with&#39;,\n &#39;his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space&#39;,\n &#39;between his legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but&#39;,\n &#34;he didn&#39;t make much headway, I thought.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an&#39;,\n &#39;adjoining room. It was cold as Iceland--no fire at all--the landlord&#39;,\n &#34;said he couldn&#39;t afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each&#34;,\n &#39;in a winding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and&#39;,\n &#39;hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But&#39;,\n &#39;the fare was of the most substantial kind--not only meat and potatoes,&#39;,\n &#39;but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in&#39;,\n &#39;a green box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful&#39;,\n &#39;manner.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;My boy,&#34; said the landlord, &#34;you\\&#39;ll have the nightmare to a dead&#39;,\n &#39;sartainty.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Landlord,&#34; I whispered, &#34;that aint the harpooneer is it?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Oh, no,&#34; said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, &#34;the harpooneer&#39;,\n &#34;is a dark complexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he don&#39;t--he eats&#34;,\n ...]</div>"]}}],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import re\n\ndef replace_n_mark(str):\n\n    replace_char = ['.', '\"', '-',
